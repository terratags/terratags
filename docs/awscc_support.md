# AWSCC Provider Support

Terratags now supports the AWS Cloud Control (AWSCC) provider's tag format, which differs from the standard AWS provider tag format.

## Tag Format Differences

### AWS Provider Tag Format

The AWS provider uses a map of key-value pairs for tags:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Example Bucket"
    Environment = "Test"
    Owner       = "DevOps"
    Project     = "Terratags"
  }
}
```

### AWSCC Provider Tag Format

The AWSCC provider uses a list of maps with `key` and `value` fields:

```hcl
resource "awscc_apigateway_rest_api" "example" {
  name = "example-api"
  
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "Example API"
    },
    {
      key   = "Environment"
      value = "Test"
    },
    {
      key   = "Owner"
      value = "API Team"
    },
    {
      key   = "Project"
      value = "Terratags"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Default Tags Support

**Important**: The AWSCC provider does not support `default_tags`. Each AWSCC resource must specify all required tags directly in its `tags` attribute.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  
  # AWS provider supports default_tags
  default_tags {
    tags = {
      Owner       = "DevOps"
      Project     = "Terratags"
    }
  }
}

provider "awscc" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  # AWSCC provider doesn't support default_tags
}
```

## Validation

Terratags validates AWSCC resources by:

1. Detecting resources with the `awscc_` prefix
2. Parsing the list-of-maps tag format
3. Validating that all required tags are present
4. Reporting any missing tags

## Example

Here's a complete example showing both AWS and AWSCC resources with their respective tag formats:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    awscc = {
      source  = "hashicorp/awscc"
      version = "~> 0.67"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  
  default_tags {
    tags = {
      Owner       = "DevOps"
      Project     = "Terratags"
    }
  }
}

provider "awscc" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# AWS resource with tags in map format
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "Example Bucket"
    Environment = "Test"
    # Owner and Project come from default_tags
  }
}

# AWSCC resource with tags in list-of-maps format
resource "awscc_apigateway_rest_api" "example" {
  name = "example-api"
  
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "Name"
      value = "Example API"
    },
    {
      key   = "Environment"
      value = "Test"
    },
    {
      key   = "Owner"
      value = "API Team"
    },
    {
      key   = "Project"
      value = "Terratags"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Excluded AWSCC Resources

Some AWSCC resources have non-compliant tag schemas and are excluded from validation. These resources are shown in a separate "Excluded" category in the compliance report.

The compliance percentage calculation doesn't include these excluded resources, ensuring that your compliance metrics accurately reflect only the resources that should be properly tagged.

Excluded resources include: 
- `awscc_amplifyuibuilder_component`
- `awscc_amplifyuibuilder_form`
- `awscc_amplifyuibuilder_theme`
- `awscc_apigatewayv2_api`
- `awscc_apigatewayv2_domain_name`
- `awscc_apigatewayv2_vpc_link`
- `awscc_batch_compute_environment`
- `awscc_batch_job_queue`
- `awscc_batch_scheduling_policy`
- `awscc_bedrock_agent`
- `awscc_bedrock_agent_alias`
- `awscc_bedrock_knowledge_base`
- `awscc_eks_nodegroup`
- `awscc_fis_experiment_template`
- `awscc_greengrassv2_component_version`
- And others with non-standard tag implementations

These resources are identified in the HTML report in a dedicated "Excluded Resources" section.

This sample report shows how excluded resources are separated from the compliance calculation and displayed in their own section.
